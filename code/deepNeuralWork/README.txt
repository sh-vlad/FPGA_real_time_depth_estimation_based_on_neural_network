# This module should be able to give depth map based on two video channels in real time. 
# Second purpose is to be small enough to be portable in FPGA in sence of memory and 
# paralleling computational resourses. In the last case it shouls give depth-map good 
# enough to be pleasant for the human. 
# Third aim is to do all the aformentioned things for the high quality video to show it 
# in big screen.
